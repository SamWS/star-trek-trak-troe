#h1 TREK-TRAK-TROE

This is a basic game of tic tac toe inspired by Star Trek. To make this game, I used:

*HTML5

*CSS

*Javascript/jQuery


#h2 How to play

*Select a character using the mousepad

*Once you've selected a character, player 2 will have it's image assigned automatically

*Player one will then select a spot on the grid he wants to play

*Player two will then select his position

*This will continue until someone wins or the game results in a draw
